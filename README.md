This repository contains a detailed process of identifying customer churn at LBG.

I selected the customer demographics because this will give me an insight into knowing the customers and will make it easier to link them to their patterns, 		
Their transaction history is also very important component to understand the customers more, their spending style, and trends 		
And finally customer service history will help me understand how the customer service department has either played a positive or negative role in retaining the customers each time they have complaints or issues are raised. How were their issues resolved, how fast were they attended to, did they have a good experience?		
All of these will be significant in understanding the customer churn and making future predictions on improvements that will set LBG on a greater part		
			
			
Customer ID, Age, marital status and income level can give us some insights		
Customer ID, amount spent- can drop transaction id		
All the features on customer_service will be quite  interaction id can be dropped too	

From the inspection i observed that a total of 668 customers reached out to customer service, that means 332 never contacted customer service that could mean they never had issues

The data types are in correct format, there are no missing values, the customer id which is the unique identifier cuts across all data sets equally
